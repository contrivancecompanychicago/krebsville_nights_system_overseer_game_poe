      @Krebsville_Overseer SYSTEM_START: Dr. Grant initializing Scene 1.


      Location: Zone 0 (Emergency Room Bay). Status: OPEN | Hazard: 0. Patient:
      SP-000. Current Economy: 3,480 Credits | 39 Time Tokens.


      Narrative Start: I have just arrived at the ER Bay. The air is sterile but
      the power is fluctuating. Dr. Morgan is at the triage station struggling
      with the monitor for Patient SP-000. I need to perform the Vitals Override
      using Sync Code [SYNC-1561].


      Describe the scene and Dr. Morgan’s reaction as I approach the terminal.
