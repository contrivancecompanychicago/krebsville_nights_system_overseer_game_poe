🏥 **KREBSVILLE NIGHTS: UNEQUAL TREATMENT** ☣️

Welcome to the Waste Zones, Dr. Grant. 

In this medical-noir RPG, you must stabilize 100 dying zones during the DOVIC-26 outbreak. But the System is against you—resources are diverted to high-credit citizens, leaving you with failing tech and zero backup.

### 🎮 HOW TO PLAY:
1. **The Goal:** Stabilize the zone status before the Hazard Level hits 5.
2. **The Cost:** Every move and major action costs **1 Time Token**. 
3. **The Struggle:** Use your **ARP Credits** to bypass lockdowns or buy priority equipment.
4. **The Command:** Type **"Status Report"** at any time to see your current Zone, Credits, and Time Tokens.

### 📍 CURRENT LOCATION:
**Scene 1: Zone 0 (Emergency Room Bay)**
The lights are flickering, the monitors are desynced, and the Systemic Overseer is watching. 

*Will you save the patient, or will the clock run out?*
