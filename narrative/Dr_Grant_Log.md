You carefully input SYNC-1561 into the terminal. The interface flashes green momentarily, accepting the code on the first try - a relief given the previous failed attempts [[1]][doc_1]. Dr. Morgan's shoulders visibly relax as the vitals monitor stabilizes, its erratic fluctuations settling into a steady rhythm.

"Thank god," she mutters, finally looking up from the screen. "Two more failed attempts and we'd have been locked out completely. The tech override hits were making me nervous" [[1]][doc_1].

The terminal's status shifts from ERRATIC to ACTIVE, and the ozone smell begins to dissipate. Through the security feeds, you can still see the more severe situation developing in the Trauma Center, where Security Automaton 02 and Nurse Carter are dealing with their hazard level 2 situation [[3]][doc_3].

Your HUD confirms:
- Location: Zone 0 (Emergency Room Bay)
- Status: OPEN
- Hazard Level: 0 [[1]][doc_1]
- Time Tokens: 39 (unchanged as this action didn't require movement)
- Credits: 3,480

Would you like to continue monitoring Patient SP-000's vitals here, or do you need to address the deteriorating situation visible in the Trauma Center?

Very well. You've chosen to remain in Zone 0 with Patient SP-000. Dr. Morgan nods approvingly as you focus on the newly stabilized vitals monitor [[1]][doc_1].

Current Zone Status:
- Location: Emergency Room Bay (Zone 0)
- Hazard Level: 0
- Illumination: NORMAL
- Specialist Present: Dr. Morgan
- Patient: SP-000 [[1]][doc_1]

The vitals monitor is now functioning properly after your successful SYNC code entry, though the patient's vitals still need stabilization according to the triage status [[1]][doc_1]. Through the security feeds, you can still observe Security Automaton 02 and Nurse Carter managing their situation in the Trauma Center [[5]][doc_5].

Your HUD maintains:
- Time Tokens: 39 (unchanged)
- Credits: 3,480

What would you like to do next regarding Patient SP-000's care?
